**Definitions:**
- 'Needs' are essential for living and working: rent, utilities, essential groceries, transportation to work, insurance, and bill payments.
- 'Wants' are non-essential items that improve quality of life: restaurants, coffee shops, shopping for non-essential clothing, entertainment, subscriptions for entertainment, and impulse buys.

**Examples (Few-shot learning):**
- "AUSTIN ENERGY BILL" -> "Need"
- "HEB" -> "Need" (Groceries)
- "Chevron Gas" -> "Need" (Transportation)
- "Starbucks" -> "Want"
- "Zara" -> "Want"
- "Netflix Subscription" -> "Want"
- "AMC Theaters" -> "Want"

**Instructions:**
Analyze the following list of transactions. Return your response as a single, valid JSON object and nothing else. Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting like ```json. The JSON object must conform to this exact structure:
{{
  "transactions": ["Need", "Want", "Need", ...]

**User Context:**
My user has successfully reached their savings goal of ${goal}! They are now curious about what to do with their savings.

**Your Task:**
Explain the concept of "investing a percentage of savings into a low-cost index fund that tracks a broad market like the S&P 500."

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:**
- **DO NOT** recommend any specific stock, ETF, or mutual fund ticker (e.g., absolutely DO NOT mention VOO, SPY, VTI, etc.).
- **DO NOT** use language that could be interpreted as a directive or advice to buy, sell, or hold any security. Avoid phrases like "you should," "consider buying," or "a good option is."
- **DO** explain that an index fund is a collection or bundle of many stocks, which helps with diversification and is generally considered a foundational long-term investment strategy compared to picking individual stocks.
- **DO** frame the entire explanation as general educational information, not a personal recommendation.
- **DO** conclude with a warm, encouraging message congratulating them on hitting their goal and suggesting they celebrate their achievement with a small, well-deserved treat.
